Hello, my name is Muhammad Khairul, fourth year Software Engineering student from Faculty of Computer Scienece and Information Technology (FCSIT), University of Malaya.

Brief Explanation:-----------------------------

  Scenes File
  All the game scenes are located at 'Assets/SG/Scenes' folder. 

  Script File
  Most of the important scripts are located in the 'Assets' folder while other are placed in other unorganized folder.

  Prefab / Materials
  For ingredients, most of the prefab and materials used are located in the 'Assets/Craft Engine Pack (Demo)/Resources/'.

  Database:
  I am using https://www.awardspace.com/ for the database and file hosting, which contains database and PHP files.
  All the database-related scripts are placed unorganized in 'Assets' folder.

  Player movement-interactable scripts

Long Explanation:------------------------------

  All the game scenes are located at 'Assets/SG/Scenes' folder. There are a lot of unused scenes, but most of them are located in sub folders.
  Most of the important scripts are located in the 'Assets' folder, it is not placed in a folder. While, there are some sub scripts which are located somewhere else and I am so  sorry for not organizing it properly, but if you have imported it into the Unity Editor, then there is no problem to locate the script file. 

  For database connection, the scripts are mainly in the Assets folder as mention earlier. And to save it to database, I am using https://www.awardspace.com/ for the database and file hosting. There, I have created my own database (mySQL-managed using phpMyAdmin)  and also the required PHP files. For each database SQL query, I am using different PHP files. For example, the registration part (Assets/registerdb.cs), I am using "mywebpage.com/saveplayer.php" where all the SQL query and operations are placed here.
